These are good questions, and VAR models have been used in various ways and thus have also been motivated in various ways. The easiest motivation is to note that a VAR model simply links the current observation to past observation. As such, a VAR model is claiming that there are some dynamics in the system -- whether that's an economy, a business, the oxygen level of a person, etc -- and that these dynamics are well described by a linear function that links the current observation to a **finite past**.\n",

However, it turns out that the previous statement is not entirely correct, the reason for which is the companion form. The companion form of a VAR(p) is basically a re-interpretation that shows that any VAR(p) can be written as a VAR(1) if we extend out state vector. State vectors do not usually come up in VAR analysis, however, $\\by_t$ is nothing but a vector of states, all of which observed, which evolves over time. The choice of states to include at time $t$ is arbitrary, as long as no future information is included -- the basic assumption is that time $t$ state vectors are fully observable at time $t$. \n",
